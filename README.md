# mapslocationdummy

I will make tutorial in a next few days how to make Google MapView with Google Maps API working with users current location.  

If you want to make this before tutorial I have one tip, implement following lifecycle methods: onResume(), onDestroy(), onPause(), onLowMemory()
or MapView won't work.
